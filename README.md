# ArtificialIntelligence_MinimaxAlgorithm

This program implements the Minimax algorithm in order to find the best possible plan for a given 3 Mens Morris Game (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_men%27s_morris).

The program was first written to just implement the Minimax algorithm, but was later changed in future revisions to implement the Minimax algorithm with alpha beta pruning to decrease the average running time of the program.
